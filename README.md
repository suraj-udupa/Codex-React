# Codex React

A lightweight React login screen designed to run directly in modern desktop and mobile browsers.

## Running locally

Because the project is built with CDN-hosted React, you only need a static server to try it out:

```bash
python -m http.server 4173
```

Then open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) on your phone or desktop browser. The layout is responsive and touch-friendly.
